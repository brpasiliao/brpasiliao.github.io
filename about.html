              is a Unity Game Developer based in NYC. She is currently engaging 
              in contract work ranging from enhancing early prototypes and 
              debugging past projects for <a class="link" href="https://playmatics.com/" target="_blank">Playmatics</a>,
              to creating AI opponents in a multiplayer game for <a class="link" href="https://dusksharp.com/" target="_blank">Dusk Sharp</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although she did not start from having a formal game development 
              education, her background in Computer Science and Interaction Design 
              helped her learn quickly. She gained experience through completing 
              a game development internship, participating in numerous game jams, 
              and undertaking personal projects.
            </p>

              In the past, Bian has volunteered for the <a class="link" href="https://www.egdcollective.org/" target="_blank">EGD Collective</a>, 
              a non-profit organization dedicated to helping students who aim to 
              join the games industry. She enjoys attending game dev events, being 
              creative with even more personal projects, and taking care of her plants.
